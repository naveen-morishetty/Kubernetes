First, the user wants a 2-day roadmap to revise Kubernetes from basic to advanced for cracking an interview. It's a revision plan, so it should be structured, comprehensive, and focused on key concepts.

</think>### 2-Day Kubernetes Revision Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for quick revision from basics to advanced Kubernetes concepts, assuming you have some prior exposure. Focus on understanding core ideas, key commands, and practical scenarios to prepare for interviews. Dedicate 4-6 hours per day, mixing theory with hands-on practice (use tools like Minikube, Kind, or a free cloud sandbox like Katacoda/Play with Kubernetes). Reference official docs (kubernetes.io), YouTube channels (e.g., TechWorld with Nana), and practice with kubectl commands.

Aim to cover 80% theory and 20% labs each day. End each day with mock interview questions (e.g., from LeetCode or Glassdoor) and review common pitfalls.

#### Day 1: Foundations and Core Components (Basics to Intermediate)
Focus on building a solid understanding of Kubernetes architecture and essential resources. By end of day, you should explain how a pod deploys and scales.

- **Morning: Basics and Architecture (2-3 hours)**
  - What is Kubernetes? (Container orchestration, benefits over Docker Swarm).
  - Key components: Clusters, Nodes (Master/Worker), Control Plane (API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager).
  - Pods: Lifecycle, multi-container pods, init containers.
  - Hands-on: Create a simple pod YAML, deploy with `kubectl apply`, check status with `kubectl get pods`.
  - Resource: Read Kubernetes docs on "Concepts" section.

- **Afternoon: Deployments and Scaling (2-3 hours)**
  - ReplicaSets and Deployments: Rolling updates, rollbacks, scaling.
  - Services: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer; Ingress for external access.
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets: Managing app configs and sensitive data.
  - Volumes: Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), StorageClasses.
  - Hands-on: Deploy a web app (e.g., Nginx) with a Deployment, expose via Service, add a ConfigMap, and scale replicas.
  - Resource: Watch a 30-min video on Deployments (e.g., Nana's playlist).

- **Evening Review (30-60 mins)**
  - Practice commands: `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl exec`.
  - Mock Qs: "Explain pod-to-pod communication" or "How does a Deployment differ from a ReplicaSet?"

#### Day 2: Advanced Topics and Interview Prep (Intermediate to Advanced)
Dive into production-ready features, security, and troubleshooting. By end of day, focus on real-world scenarios like securing and monitoring clusters.

- **Morning: Networking and Security (2-3 hours)**
  - Networking: CNI plugins (e.g., Calico, Flannel), Network Policies for traffic control.
  - Security: RBAC (Roles, RoleBindings), Service Accounts, Pod Security Standards.
  - Namespaces: Isolation and resource quotas.
  - Hands-on: Set up a Network Policy to restrict pod traffic, create RBAC for a user.
  - Resource: Kubernetes docs on "Networking" and "Security".

- **Afternoon: Advanced Tools and Operations (2-3 hours)**
  - Helm: Charts, releases, templating for app packaging.
  - Operators: Custom controllers (e.g., for databases).
  - Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, Grafana; EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana).
  - Troubleshooting: Common issues (e.g., pod crashes, resource limits), debugging with `kubectl` and logs.
  - Hands-on: Install Helm, deploy a chart (e.g., WordPress), troubleshoot a failing pod.
  - Resource: Quick Helm tutorial (official docs) and a video on Operators.

- **Evening Review and Interview Simulation (30-60 mins)**
  - Practice advanced commands: `kubectl top`, `kubectl debug`, Helm commands.
  - Mock Qs: "How would you secure a Kubernetes cluster?" or "Explain Helm vs. kubectl." Simulate an interview by explaining a scenario (e.g., "Design a HA setup for a microservice").
  - Tips: Review CKAD/CKA exam objectives for common topics. Focus on explaining "why" (e.g., why use Ingress over LoadBalancer?).

**General Tips for Success:**
- **Practice Labs:** Use free platforms like Kubernetes Playground or set up a local cluster with Minikube.
- **Resources:** Official Kubernetes docs, "Kubernetes in Action" book (skim key chapters), and interview prep sites like HackerRank.
- **Interview Focus:** Be ready for behavioral questions (e.g., "Describe a time you debugged a K8s issue") and design questions (e.g., "Architect a scalable app on K8s").
- **Track Progress:** Note down weak areas and revisit them. If you finish early, explore cloud-specific K8s (e.g., EKS/GKE).

This plan is intensive but achievable—adjust based on your pace. Good luck cracking the interview! If you need resources for specific topics, let me know.
